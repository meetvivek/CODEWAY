# CodeWay Internship Projects

Welcome to the CodeWay Internship Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed during my Python programming internship. Each project showcases different skills and concepts learned throughout the internship period.

## Project List

1. **To-Do List**: A simple to-do list application developed using Python and TKinter. It allows users to add, delete, and update tasks, helping them stay organized and productive.

2. **Calculator**: A simple calculator application built using Python's tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Password Generator and Manager**: A secure password generator and manager application developed with Python and TKinter. Users can generate strong passwords and securely store them alongside website details.

4. **Weather Forecast Application**: A weather forecast web application built with Python and Flask. It retrieves real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on user input.

5. **Quiz Game**: A quiz game web application created using Python and Flask. It fetches quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API and allows users to test their knowledge in various categories.
